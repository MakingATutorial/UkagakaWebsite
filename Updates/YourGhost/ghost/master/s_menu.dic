As you go through this file, look at how every menu option is set up, and you will see they all follow this format, give or take a \![*].

//*********************Advanced User Info*******************************
//Some of you may be wondering why some of these Select.options lead to another function. Why not just put the config menu coding under Select.configmenu, instead of linking to TalkConfig?
//Basically any function that's preceded with Select. is limited in its complexity and can only be called within its own .dic file in my experience. Why should you care, you ask? Well, if you're going to link to this function any other way, such as linking it in other .dic files or as a page in a menu, it needs to be a stand-alone function so it can be properly called. I'm pretty sure.
//The basic jist is this; if you're going to reuse whatever it is the option leads to, you should make it its own function. Otherwise, you can leave it in Select.option. As a rule of thumb I'd probably put any complicated stuff in its own function, then use the Select.option to call the full function as you can see above. Simple dialogue responses to a choice can stay as a Select.option though. Study what stays as a Select.option and what links to another Function as we go through the file.
